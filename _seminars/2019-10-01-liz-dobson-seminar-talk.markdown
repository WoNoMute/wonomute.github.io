### Abstract

Human development is mediated through a moment-by-moment relationship with our situation; shaped by cultural contexts, social interactions, and the use of physical tools, which are themselves developed out of the concepts that shape thinking and learning about music. Music Technology education however, is often viewed in terms of how technology is designed and the kinds of learning and creativity that it affords. Empirically, the emphasis is more often around human computer interaction. Drawing on Lev Vygotsky’s work on how our interface with the world shapes higher mental development, I will present a case for understanding the influence of human interaction and community on music technology education. 

Following my PhD investigating the social psychology of collaborative creativity in 2012, I developed of a set of practice principles for music technology education. This particular approach to supporting learning and creativity was explored through an extra-curricular multi-disciplinary collaboration sandpit, where students launched new projects, forming a professional practice network alongside their formal education. Encouraged by the impact of this on their personal development, I felt that something similar could be available for women in audio as statistics show our audio industries to be so overwhelmingly male; I called the first meeting of the Yorkshire Sound Women Network in 2015. 

In this talk I will discuss relationships between learning, social capital, collaborative enterprise and professional development in this context, and how this has opened new avenues of personal creative practice, as well as new multimodal research on interaction amongst girls participating in music technology education.

### Abstract

Music and movement are intimately connected in many different ways. Both with respect to how musical sounds and rhythms are produced by players, but also how this non-verbal communication is perceived by an audience. The study of music and movement in the past decades have shown the relation to the body is important for players and listeners alike, proving music to be a multimodal experience.
In this talk I will present examples of studies of musical movement from both these perspectives and discuss some of the challenges and questions that arise when studying movements in music performance. How can movements primarily intended for the production of communicative sounds be evaluated? What characterizes an "efficient" and "appropriate" movement? Is it at all possible to disentangle expression from control when studying musicians' movements?


### Bio

[Sofia Dahl](http://www.sofiadahl.net/) holds a PhD in Speech and Music communication from KTH, Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden. She  is associate professor at Aalborg University, campus Copenhagen and has been Visiting Associate Professor in Embodied Music Cognition at University of Oslo.
With a background from electrical engineering and musicology, Dahl’s research interests relate to how we produce, perceive and communicate with music with a focus on rhythmic movement and emotional communication.  Over time, Dahl’s  field of research has become increasingly transdisciplinary and spans disciplines such as music cognition and psychology, music performance, neuroscience, media technology, and music acoustics.

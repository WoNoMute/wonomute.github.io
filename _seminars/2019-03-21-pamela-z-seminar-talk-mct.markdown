### Abstract

Pamela Z's performances range in scale from small concerts in galleries to large-scale multi-media works in theaters and concert halls. Her solo works combine experimental extended vocal techniques, operatic bel canto, found objects, text, and sampled concrète sounds. She uses MAX MSP and Isadora software on a MacBook Pro along with custom MIDI controllers. One of her early instruments,The BodySynth™, was created by Chris Van Raalte and Ed Severinghaus (Copyright 1994), a MIDI controller that transforms movement, gestures, and other muscle efforts into sounds. Another part of her setup has been custom MIDI interfaces including faders, footswitch control pod, light controllers, and ultrasonic controllers, developed and fabricated by Donald Swearingen as part of his "N Degrees" system of sensor controllers. In this session, Pamela Z will demonstrate her current solo performance set-up, discuss how everything works and give a live performance/demonstration of some of the tools she uses in performance (including voice, processing, gesture control, and interaction with video.)

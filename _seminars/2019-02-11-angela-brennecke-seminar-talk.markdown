### Abstract

This seminar will take the audience on a journey into introducing a new technology-based Master’s program called Creative Technologies at the Film University Babelsberg *KONRAD WOLF*, one of Germany’s most well-established and traditional film schools, and getting acquainted with the different perspectives on audio, graphics & interactive media technologies specifically relevant to this context. The study program extends the Film University’s portfolio by a computer science based Master that focuses on creative coding and the development of interactive audio & graphics media technologies specifically tailored to the artistic goals of digital media artists and/or technological needs in media productions. It has turned out to be of particular interest to students with a strong technological background who would like to expand on their artistic talents as well as to digital media artists who would like to expand on their technological knowledge and improve on using software and technology as artistic tools. Against this background, Angela will present the audience with her own experiences in music, science and technology and will further expand on her artistic as well as academic goals she would like to further establish as part of the study program. Among others, these comprise creative coding for story telling and the exploration of the close relationship between audio and graphics.

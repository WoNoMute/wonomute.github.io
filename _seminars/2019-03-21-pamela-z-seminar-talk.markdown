### Abstract

Pamela has a large production of works of different formats and concepts: voice and <a href="http://www.pamelaz.com/concerts.html">electronics pieces</a>, <a href="http://www.pamelaz.com/largescale.html">large-scale performance works</a>, <a href="http://www.pamelaz.com/installations.html">installation works</a> and commissioned works for different ensembles and situations. She curates and produces "the ROOM Series", a San Francisco avant-chamber series featuring the work of a variety of virtuosic solo artists and chamber groups playing experimental music. She has collaborated with a wide range of artists including Joan La Barbara, Joan Jeanrenaud, Brenda Way (ODC Dance), Miya Masaoka, Jeanne Finley + John Muse, Shinichi Iova Koga (Inkboat), Christina McPhee, and Luciano Chessa. She has participated in several New Music Theatre events (including John Cage festivals), and has performed with The San Francisco Contemporary Music Players. Her interactive web-based work Baggage Allowance can be viewed at <a href="http://www.baggageallowance.tv/">baggageallowance.tv</a> where it is permanently installed. In this talk Pamela will give a lecture focusing on her practice as a composer/performer and media artist. She will show some documentation examples of her work, and discuss her process for making live work and fixed media.

We are devoting today’s celebration to the women who have fought for 100 years for [equal rights](https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/from-the-archive-blog/2012/mar/08/clara-zetkin-international-womens-day), visibility and [social justice](https://time.com/5187268/international-womens-day-history/) across the globe.

Let’s keep up the struggle! 



To promote the music of women composers, music technologists and more, we have taken the liberty of remixing the music from some of our 
WoNoMute network members along with some favorite tracks. We aimed for diversity and exchange, feel free to comment your favorite track of

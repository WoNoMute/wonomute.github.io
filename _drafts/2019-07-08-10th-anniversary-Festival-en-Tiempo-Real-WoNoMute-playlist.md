This playlist showcases the work of 10 artists from the WoNoMute network: [Tone Åse](), [Natasha Barrett](), [Ada Hoel](), [Ane Bjerkan](), [Liz Dobson](), [Gyrid Nordal Kaldestad](), [Mari Lesteberg](), [Anna Xambó](), [Kristin Nordeval]() and [Alex-Murray Leslie]() (Chicks on Speed). This playlist celebrates 10 years of the music festival [Festival en Tiempo Real](https://tiemporealyladob.wordpress.com/), and is a collaboration with her director Ana Maria Romano. The sound creations are framed within experimental, glitch, electroacoustic and contemporary, pieces where there is an encounter with the technology (from an open sense). This playlist has been curated by Anna Xambó and Karolina Jawad from Ana Maria Romano's initiative.

The playlist starts with *Raised, Rave* by Tone Åse and Thomas Strønen from the album [Voxpheria](https://www.discogs.com/Tone-Åse-Thomas-Strønen-Voxpheria/release/3406112). This piece explores the limits of experimental jazz and live electronics with the stunning voice of Tone Åse, which is deconstructed and defragmented over the course of the piece.

We continue with an extract of Natasha Barrett's *Involuntary Expression*, an acousmatic composition realised in 6th-order 3D ambisonics. XX

Next, Ada Hoel's *Under / Time* combines experimental with electronic music using crossadaptive techniques and inspired by underwater aesthetics.

The piece *We Are the Young Ones* by Ane Bjerkan is a self-production with a drum machine and a green bullet through guitar amp.

Liz Dobson's *Body Part* is a short piece that experiments with sound and space. The piece is constructed from recordings of Liz's violin.

*Mista Deg* by Gyrid Nordal Kaldestad Trio with Anne Hytta (Hardanger fiddle), Are Lothe Kolbeinsen (guitar) and Gyrid Nordal Kaldestad (song and harmonium).

Mari Lesteberg

*Kicks & Cuts* by Anna Xambó is a remix of her other piece *Kicks*, which explores the original source within the self-built live coding environment [MIRLC](https://github.com/axambo/MIRLC). The rhythm of the source is repeated creating slight out of phases, the rhythmic audio features of the audio source determine the shape of overlaid noisy beeps, and related glitchy sounds from [Freesound.org](https://freesound.org) are combined to the textural sound mass.

These are all from my solo album - "Aural Histories: post-ambient arias for voice and electronics”  - released on Pauline Oliveros´  Deep Listening label in 2012.  Alex Ross - The New Yorker´s classical music critic - listed the album among his Top 10 favorite classical recordings for 2012.

*Happy Birthday was created by playing with fragments read from a visualisation of the word Happy Birthday, and a PD patch called "My Voice Means" both made by Ron Herrema. The experiment was presented at SPUR residency at Tate Britain in January 2015 as part of the Radio City project. It was broadcast through the gallery radio system and later SPUR invited me to exhibit online this work together with the visual work of Sophy Alda. Here I am quoting the perception of my work by Sophy Alda: "Yours as a piece to be broadcast amongst other readings through the gallery radio system, and mine as a visual response to the project.
Your piece to me seems to be a breaking up of and recontextualization of a familiar pattern of syllables (one with some degree of individual weight through memory in English speakers) presented out of order and repetitively to create an evocative soundscape verging on the hypnotic.

The presentation of this through a multi space and multi speaker broadcast system seems particularly effective as it echoes the broken up nature of the sound but also facilitates the intimate consumption of it: it is up to the consumer to decide how near or far they are from the the sound and how much attention they pay to it, their experience changing as they move through the space in which it is being broadcast.

This seems relevant in the gallery space as relayed through the gallery radio system, but also in the browser space which is almost always accessed intentionally and with autonomy. The work can be experienced by any number of people broken up between places and although their individual experiences can still be intercepted by those nearby they retain a sense of real intimacy."

We finish this playlist with the anthem for equality *Utopia* by Chicks on Speed.

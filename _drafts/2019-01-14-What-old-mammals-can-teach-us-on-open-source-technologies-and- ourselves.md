The notion of a global online community is resonating again. Mainstream tech platforms that provide cost free services occupied this notion to the extend that it almost got forgotten. In the meantime the <a href="https://fediverse.party/">'Fediverse Ecosystem'</a> evolved.. And it is worth inspecting it, let's see why


## Do we really need alternative social media networks?
Yes. Innovation and creativity needs diversity and <a href="https://magazine.areweeurope.com/silentrevolutions/stories/ellyn-valkengoed-protesting-in-the-age-of-social-media">dissent</a>. Basic civil rights like free speech and privacy are <a href="https://globalvoices.org/specialcoverage/billions-served-human-rights-in-the-facebook-era/">fading</a> and the monetization of the social experience on platforms like Facebook grew into a homogeneous online involvement. Since most of the 'social' media platforms are build on a hierarchical, centralised structures 'walled gardens' it is easier to have control on content, application and much more. However, there are social networks that work outside the valley-start-up horizon - the so called federated ecologies. Associating and connecting outside those big tech giants can become consequently a refreshing practice and a good beginning to return the control of the content distribution channels to the people. Anyhow, it is not about introducing the next 'big thing' everyone has to rush for as rather new ways of coexting beside big tech giants, join smoothly, radically or just leave it to be.

"We’re so conditioned to the venture capital world of startups nowadays that we intuitively think that all new tech ventures need to make it big or go bust. But that’s not the nature of the economic model behind the fediverse, which is sustainable already, while just happily ticking along." Peter O'Shaughnessy


## Decentral and open web? Mastodon and the Fediverse!
The Fediverse ecosystem is not a website to sign up to. Instead you will find <a hfref="https://the-federation.info/">hundreds</a> of independent open source websites and servers powered by citizens all around the world that are in fedaration with each other without being owned by any single company. Each of them is an installation of software which supports one of the federated open web protocols like ActivityPub, Ostatus or XXMP. No matter where you register you’ll be able to connect and associate with friends and users of other servers from the Fediverse in a free, decentralised manner.
As decentralization is way harder to imagine because its entities are differing from one instance/website.. to another it might be the best to imagine writing an email from different services. They also rely on the same type of p2p (peer to peer) protocol even though the email adresses have different domain names.

The most popular website from the Fediverse is called 'Mastodon'. Eugen Rochko started to develop Mastodon, named after an old mammal from the ice age that 'browses' for its diet, it can run on different nodes/servers/instances. The so called 'toots', 500 character messages remind a bit on Twitter and it's tweets. Indeed, Rochko mentioned he sought to build something like similar to Twitter, but with better features. The people, servers or instances you follow appear in your multi-columned timeline, even though they are from different websites. Everything related to Mostodon can be found on GitHub.


After all, we should be aware that "leaving mainstream networks behind and joining Fediverse you do not automatically gain privacy (...) (It) will, however, protect from corporate mass surveillance" (Fediverse Party). It gives everyone an opportunity to, in part, diversify their online social universe, and prevent money from being the sole deciding factor in who gets to see, hear, or say anything on the internet (Tremaine Friske). 


Long story short, watch us or meet you there.

excerpt: Why is it still so difficult for many people to imagine if not practice different ways of associating and connecting outside Facebook? Being absent now for 7-8 years I communicate with my friends and family on so called 'alternative' instant messengers and that was mostly enough to stay up to date. Besides the little research efforts I have to make to learn about interesting events, I was indeed missing this notion of a global community, that used to be mentioned when talking about the internet. And that still existed as an idea somewhere. To settle off to new spaces and new technologies in social media in connection to WoNoMute is close. But as a guest and an international student one has to adapt to local circumstances, habits or cultural preferences speaking in this case from a social media perspective (using google more than I am comfortable with for instance). Being in this reality the best thing seemed to write first about this experience and it alternative horizons.

Why is it still so difficult for many people to practice/imagine different ways of associating and connecting outside Facebook? Being absent now for 7-8 years I communicate with my friends and family on so called 'alternative' instant messengers and that was mostly enough to be up to date. Besides the little research efforts I have to make to learn about interesting events, I was only missing this notion of a global community, that used to be mentioned when talking about the internet. And that still existed as an idea somewhere. The idea to settle off to new spaces and new technologies in social media in connection to WoNoMute is close. But as a guest and an international student one has to adapt to local circumstances, habits or cultural preferences speaking in this case from a social media perspective (I had to start using google more than I am comfortable with for instance). Being in this reality the best thing seemed to write first about this experience and it alternative horizons.


Facebook occupied this idea of a 'Global Community' long time enough under fraud slogans and long friends lists. The company is still not tired of claiming the illusion to connect people while it mainly “exploit[s] a vulnerability in human psychology” by creating a “social-validation feedback loop” as the platforms former Ex-President Sean Parker said. In a state in which societies are determined in almost every aspects by technological conditions mainstream tech platforms that provide cost free services should become an alternative again instead of invading the standard.


## Do we really need alternative social media networks?
Yes. Innovation and creativity needs diversity and dissent. Basic civil and political rights like free speech and privacy deteriorating globally on a daily base. Also the most evident events like climate change could turn into fake news promoted properly. Among others, this platform became specifically a place in which extreme content gets amplified and emotions easily stirred up, - everything under the main category of friendship. The monetization of the social experience is a homogeneous experience and with its growing venue it is especially growing in unpredictability. However, many of us might know about these things, but maybe not so many about the alternatives out there and why it is worthy inspecting them.

The alternative lies in the first place how we relate with other computers on the network. The most 'social' media platforms are build on a hierarchical, centralised structures 'walled gardens' that make it easier to have control on content, application and much more. 
In the meantime, the 'Fediverse Ecosystem' evolved.


## Decentral and open web? Peer to peer, Mastodon and the Fediverse
The Fediverse ecosystem is not a website to sign up to. Instead you will find hundreds of independent open source websites and servers powered by citizens all around the world that are in fedaration with each other without being owned by any single company. Each of them is an installation of software which supports one of the federated open web protocols like ActivityPub, Ostatus or XXMP. No matter where you register you’ll be able to connect and associate with friends and users of other servers from the Fediverse in a free, decentralised manner.
As decentralization is way harder to imagine because the nodes and dots creating this web are differing from one to another it might be the best to imagine writing an email from different services. They also rely on the same type of p2p (peer to peer) protocol even though the email adresses have different domain names.

The most popular website from the Fediverse is called 'Mastodon'. Eugen Rochko started to develop Mastodon out of his dissatisfaction with the current state of social media and being tired to change every few years to a new platform. Named after an old mammal from the ice age that 'browses' for its diet, it can run on different nodes/servers/instances. The so called 'toots', 500 character messages remind a bit on Twitter and it's tweets. Indeed, Rochko mentioned he sought to build something like similar to Twitter, but with better features. But it is by far way more than that. The people, servers or instances you follow appear in your multi-columned timeline, even though they are from different websites. Everything related to Mostodon can be found on GitHub.

Be aware that "leaving mainstream networks behind and joining Fediverse you do not automatically gain privacy (...) (It) will, however, protect from corporate mass surveillance" (Fediverse Party). It gives everyone an opportunity to, in part, diversify their online social universe, and prevent money from being the sole deciding factor in who gets to see, hear, or say anything on the internet (Tremaine Friske).

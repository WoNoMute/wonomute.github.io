excerpt: Why is it still so difficult for many users to imagine different ways of associating and connecting outside Facebook? I communicate with my friends and family on 'alternative' instant messengers and that was mostly enough to be up to date. However, besides all the events I had to manually look up I was also missing this certain idea of a <a href="https://magazine.areweeurope.com/silentrevolutions/stories/ellyn-valkengoed-protesting-in-the-age-of-social-media">global community</a>, that is technically not only possible but happening right now. Facebook occupied this idea long time enough under fraud slogans and long friends lists. And it failed. Being absent now for 7-8 years I could see how the platform grew not only in venue, but in unpredictability. It monetizes the social experience through pretty aggressive depersonalization and the service of advertising, bought platforms like Instagram or WhatsApp, changed its interface from update to update, until it becomes a homogeneous experience with no discernible difference from the company that owns it (Tremaine Friske).

## Do we really need alternative social media networks?

Yes. Innovation and creativity needs diversity and dissent.

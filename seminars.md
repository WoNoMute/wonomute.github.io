The WoNoMute seminar series is a monthly series of lectures of women in music technology who present their work in the MCT portal, connecting the two campuses of NTNU in Trondheim and UiO in Oslo and streaming to the world.

The forthcoming talks can be checked in the sections of [calendar](/seminars/calendar/) and [forthcoming](/seminars/forthcoming/) and the previous talks can be found in our [archive](/seminars/past/) and YouTube channel. An interview of each guest speaker is also available on the WoNoMute website.

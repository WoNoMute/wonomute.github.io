For this years International Women's Day, we have made an open call across our network and beyond and also reached out to individuals to find out what is going on at home 
in times of restrictions. We asked women and female identified persons to share and document their current work via short, self made DIY video clips. The participants 
were free to choose the format in which they present their work or tell about their projects. We are glad to have received eight submissions today and hope they'll inspire you.

We are happy to announce that WoNoMute is back with our [workshop series](http://wonomute.no/workshops/forthcoming/) for people who identify as women!

From our experience over the past two years, we have learned that there is a need for a safe space for women and girls to learn about music and technology. It’s not a secret that the field of music and technology (or technology in general) still is very dominated by men. I think many of those of us who identify as female experience a kind of lonesomeness as we often experience to be the only female in a group when we are about to learn about technology related stuff.

It is easy to get the feeling that one has to be super experienced before daring to ask any questions, or to admit that you are struggling with something in a learning situation. It is easy to feel that you “represent all females” if you are the only female among men in a group. This is not a good base for learning.

This is one of the reasons why we believe that we still need an area for learning for women, where we don’t have to think about gender but just can do the things we love: learn about music and tech!

This year, all of our workshops are aimed at beginners, and there is a limited number of available spots. Most of the workshops will be online because of Covid, but there will also be a physical outdoors workshop with Kristin Norderval. 

We hope that people who perhaps have not discovered their interest in music technology yet will grab this chance to widen their horizons and learn something new! This year there will be a wide variety in subjects, and we will have a couple of workshops where the use of voice is central. As this has been requested as a topic from our attendees at earlier workshops. 

For those of you who *not* consider themself as beginners in music tech: You are of course also welcome!

### Workshop

In this workshop we will talk about recording your own vocals at home and we’ll look at different opportunities in regards of DAWs (digital audio workstations), set-ups and microphones. We will also look at how different vocals are recorded and produced with examples. This is a workshop meant to inspire you to start recording on your own – and maybe open up for new thoughts and possibilities if you already do.

The workshop will be held by singer/songwriter, Ane Bjerkan, from the peninsula Inderøy, north of Trondheim. She has a wide interest in sound and layers that merges into her music creating a deep universe of alternative pop music.

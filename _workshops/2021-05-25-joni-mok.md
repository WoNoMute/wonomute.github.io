### Workshop

In the workshop, you will be introduced to some practical UX methods , such as user flows and wireframing that can help improve the user experience in music technology. We will also explore Gestalt principles and atomic design methods to construct information visually. The goal of the short 2-hour intro workshop is to promote design thinking to people who are interested in designing music technology (e.g. music app) in a more accessible way for everyone to make and/or listen to music.

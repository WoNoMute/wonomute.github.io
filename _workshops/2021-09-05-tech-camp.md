#####*For who?*
Targeted at (High-school aged) Girls and non-binary people of ages 15-18
No previous knowledge required!
* all workshops will be in English *


#####*What?*
######In this workshop, you will be introduced some practical skills in music technology. You will also have a chance to meet new friends who share the same interests. Although the workshop is for girls, you can still join if you are boys. We invite mostly girls, because music technology is a rather underrated field for females! If we have more places, boys are of course welcome. Nevertheless, girls come first in this regard :) .

- Recording your own song + basic production in Audacity
- Intro to music production and processing with Reaper

Looking forward to seeing you all!

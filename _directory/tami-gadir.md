## Bio

Tami Gadir is a researcher and lecturer in music industry at the School of Media and Communication at RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia. Gadir was a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Oslo from 2015 to 2018, and holds a PhD from the University of Edinburgh, where she worked under the supervision of Simon Frith. Gadir has a background in classical piano performance and composition. Her research addresses the mechanisms that promote or hinder participation in musical cultures, explored primarily through the sounds, technologies, and cultures of contemporary, electronically-produced dance music. Gadir addresses such themes in her forthcoming book (Bloomsbury academic, 2019) through 8 years of participant observation and interviews with DJs, producers, and clubbers. Gadir is a co-founding committee member of [GeMus: Gender and Music Network](https://www.gemus.online/). Her work as a DJ is integral to her research.

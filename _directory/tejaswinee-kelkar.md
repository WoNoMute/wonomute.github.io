## Bio

I am a phd student with the RITMO center of excellence at University of Oslo, writing my thesis about the analysis of melody and body movement. I have a masters degree in computer science. As a singer and a harmonium player, I have trained in north indian classical music, western classical composition, and am interested in improvisation and jazz. My research is primarily about computational methods of analyzing melodic contour perception using motion-annotations. I am alsoâ€‹ interested in musical chills, and melodic memory. I have previously worked in creating algorithmic methods for raga-distributions, development of a web platform for teaching north indian music, and in HCI. Artistically, i am interested in improvisation, and recreation of the voice as a disembodied object.

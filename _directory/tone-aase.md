## Bio

Working with electronic voice-sound and acoustic voice sound, **[Tone Åse](http://www.toneaase.no/)** interacts with her fellow musicians both as a singer and as a soundmaker, stretching the instrumental capabilities of the voice and the live electronics in the improvised interplay. Her work is very much developed through her collaborations, with her trio [BOL](http://www.bol.no/), her duo [Voxpheria](http://www.toneaase.no/aasestronenduo/), and a range of other projects. Her experimental work with the vocal ensemble started as a founding member of [Kvitretten](https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kvitretten) (1991-2001) and continued as a member of, and for 2006-2011 artistic leader of, the improvising vocal ensemble [Trondheim Voices](http://www.trondheimvoices.no/). Her work with voice and live electronics has thus been the subject for her [doctoral work](https://www.researchcatalogue.net/profile/show-exposition?exposition=108003) within the Norwegian Artistic Research Programme (2008-2012). Åse has released several CD's with her groups and also composed music for film, theatre, various ensembles and projects. Åse is from 2012 [Associate professor at Department of Music, NTNU](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/tone.ase).

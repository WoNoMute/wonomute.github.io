The WoNoMute logo has been designed by [Robin Mientjes](http://rbmntjs.nl/) (KOSO, Oslo). 

> The WoNoMute identity is simple and clear. It doesnâ€™t need to be anything more than a carrier for important information. With that in mind, the logo is also a simple typographic mark. 
This mark is supported by a sans-serif type family, Dover Sans Text, which works well at small sizes and has no frivolous ornamentation or unnecessary detailing.

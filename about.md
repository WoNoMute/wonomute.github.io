This is the website and blog of the organization Women Nordic Music Technology (WoNoMute) at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) in partnership with University of Oslo (UiO), an organization that started in August 2018 and aims to promote and connect the work of women in music tech at local, national and international levels.

WoNoMute is an horizontal network organization that promotes the work of those identifying as women in the interdisciplinary field of music technology. The term music technology is used here to define activities related to the use, development and analysis of technology applied to sound and music. It is an umbrella term that connects researchers and practitioners, as well as engineers and social scientists. It is still a fact that women are underrepresented in the field of music technology. We can be agents of change to improve the current situation and promote women’s work and role models that can inspire new generations to pursue their careers in music technology. We can be agents of change that join forces and cooperate for a future better representation of women in the field of music technology. We can be agents of change by sharing our practices and tools, to positively learn from each other.  WoNoMute is based in Norway, where the physical activities take place, and it also aims to be an international organization with a meaningful online presence so that the geography is transcended.

WoNoMute started in August 2018 by Anna Xambó, who provides the vision of the organization, with the motivation to make more visible the work of women in music tech at a local, national, and international levels. The networked organization is growing quickly thanks to the generous financial support of both NTNU and UiO. It is thanks to the work and collaboration of many contributors and advisors (see the [committee webpage](/about/committee/) for the full list) that WoNoMute is what it is. WoNoMute is an open space defined and discussed by its members and produces content that should be available to all people. You can read our charter [here](/about/charter/).
